# okconceptviewer

* OkConceptviewer can perform a function similar to that of `var_dump` in PHP: a way to show all of an object's properties on the screen quickly, usually in apps under development

* The code is available [on NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/package/okconceptviewer) and [GitHub](https://github.com/pacificpelican/okviewer)

* okconceptviewer can be imported as React component: 

  * First get the default export: `import Okconceptviewer from "okconceptviewer"`

  * Then use it to display an object in your component: `return(<Okconceptviewer spreadsheetdata={{"name":"Mango", "type":"Quaker Parrot"}} />)`

* OkConceptviewer is an extraction of the `SpreadsheetCoreRecursive` component from [OkConcept0](https://okconcept0.pacificio.com)

* A version of the SpreadsheetCoreRecursive component is used to dislay objects in the [OkConcept0 project](https://github.com/pacificpelican/okconcept0)
